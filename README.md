Python Image Converter Scripts
This repository contains Python scripts that can be used to convert images to different formats, sizes, dimensions, and more.

Getting Started
To get started with these scripts, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ghulamrasuldev/python-scripts.git
Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and open the script you want to use in your preferred text editor.

Place all images that you want to convert in the same folder as the script.

Adjust the script according to your requirements, such as changing the size, dimensions, height, width, or any other parameters.

To run the Python script, open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder where the script is located using the cd command. For example, if your script is in a folder called "image-converter," you would type:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/image-converter
Then, to run the script, type:

Copy code
python script_name.py
Replace "script_name.py" with the actual name of your Python script.

Running Python Scripts on Different Operating Systems
Here are the terminal commands to run a Python file on different operating systems:

Mac: python3 /path/to/script.py
Windows: python C:\path\to\script.py
Linux: python /path/to/script.py
That's it! Your images should now be converted according to the specifications set in the Python script.
